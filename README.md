Toutiao (literally "Headlines") is a Chinese news and information content platform, a core product of the China-based company ByteDance. Everyday, thousands of news content are created and read by Toutiao's 279 million monthy active users. The content pushed to each user is different, based on the past content read and searched by each user. Classifying news content to the right topic and tailor-make content for each user is crucial for the success of the business model of Toutiao.
